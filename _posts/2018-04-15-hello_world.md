This is customary introduction which prints Hello World out there on console.

### Prerequisites
 - Python 3 (custom installation with option as install for all users)
 - PyCharmIDE (All code examples are run here)
 
As .java is to Java, .py is to Python. Just create a new file hello_world.py in IDE and write below code in it. 

```
print("hello world")
```

You can run it via IDE right click or by issuing following cmd on cmd prompt:

```
> python hello_world.py
```
  

Interesting fact :
Go on cmd prompt, type python and you will get python console.
Enter import this and you will see cool guidelines for writing code. That is known as PEP-8  

#### Naming Conventions:  

Unlike Java, Python  doesn't recommend camel cases for naming. So file names, variable names and other such declarations have lower caps with underscore has logical delimiter. For example hello_world.py and variables as customer_name and not customerName.
