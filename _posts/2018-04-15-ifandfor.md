#### If Else statements  

In Python the if else statements look like below. Note here it is `elif` and not `else if`, also instead of curly braces we have colon as the denotion of start of block. In Python indentation is very important if program is to compile and work, for this the statements under if and other constructs are indented properly.  

```
number = 3

if number == 0:
    print('zero')
elif number % 2 == 0:
    print('event')
else:
    print('odd')
```  

#### Ternary Operators  

There is no `? :` operator in Python, instead it has following construct.  
```
number = 3
odd_or_even = 'odd' if number % 2 != 0 else 'even'
print(odd_or_even)
```  

The construct is basically   
```
expression1 if condition else expression2
```` 

#### For loop
